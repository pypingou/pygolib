GOutil
======

This project provides a small utility to play with the Gene Ontology.

Using it you can:
- download the latest GO annotation file.
- extract a sub-part of the ontology
   such as, all the term which are children of a given one
    IE: extract all the terms related with "biological process"
- calculate the distance between two terms
