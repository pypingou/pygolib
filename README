pygolib
======

This project provides a python library and a small utility to play with the
Gene Ontology (and eventually any ontology provided in a OBO format).

Using it you can:
- download the latest GO annotation file.
- extract a sub-part of the ontology
   such as, all the term which are children of a given one
    IE: extract all the terms related with "biological process"
- calculate the distance between two terms using the algorithm from G-SESAME:
  http://bioinformatics.clemson.edu/G-SESAME/
- plot the tree of the ancestors of a term
- return the information known about a term

Example usage:

 goutil subpart GO:0006950

 goutil tree GO:0006950
