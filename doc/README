  the geneontology.org website on 2012-02-10.
  It represents the ontology tree for the GO term GO:0043231
test3_annotated.png is the same picture than test3.png but we added the
  semantic value for each parent with regards to GO:0043231.
  This can be used to do the calculation by hand and check the results
  of the program

All these ontology files are used in the unit-tests for test the algorithm.
